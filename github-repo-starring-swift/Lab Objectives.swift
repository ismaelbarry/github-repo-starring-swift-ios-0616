// Lab Objective:
// Bring in the code you've already written for your Github Repo List lab. You've already gotten the table view to display a list of repositories, so it's time to add some additional functionality to this app. We want to be able to tap on repos in the table view and have it star or unstar the repository appropriately, using Github's API. You can see the overview of the relevant API calls here.
